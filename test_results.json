It provides methods to reset the environment and to take a step based on the action chosen by the agent.\n\n2. **QLearningAgent Class**: This class implements the Q-learning algorithm. It maintains a Q-table to store the expected rewards for each state-action pair and includes methods for choosing actions and updating Q-values based on the agent's experiences.\n\n3. **User Interface**: The `user_interface` function displays the text and prompts the user to enter a starting position from which they want the agent to recite the text.\n\n4. **Training Function**: The `train_agent` function trains the agent over a specified number of episodes, allowing it to learn the best actions to take in the environment.\n\n5. **Testing Function**: The `test_agent` function allows the agent to recite the text starting from the user-defined position based on the learned Q-values.\n\n6. **Main Execution Block**: The program initializes the text, environment, and agent, trains the agent, and then prompts the user for a starting position to recite the text.\n\n### How to Run the Program\n1. Copy the code into a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python script).\n2. Run the program. It will train the agent and then ask for a starting position.\n3. Enter a valid starting position (between 0 and the length of the text minus one) to see the agent recite the text from that position.",
