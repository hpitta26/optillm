To address the original query of creating a reinforcement learning (RL) model to recite text from a user-specified position using only NumPy, we need to balance simplicity with the educational value of RL concepts. Given the limitations of using only NumPy for complex RL tasks, we'll focus on a basic implementation that illustrates key RL principles while acknowledging the constraints.

Here's a simplified approach:

```python
import numpy as np

class TextReciterRL:
    def __init__(self, text):
        self.text = text
        self.state_size = len(text)
        self.q_table = np.zeros(self.state_size)
        self.alpha = 0.1    # Learning rate
        self.gamma = 0.95   # Discount factor

    def step(self, position, action):
        # Reward: +1 for valid position, -1 for invalid
        if 0 <= position < self.state_size:
            reward = 1
        else:
            reward = -1
        
        new_position = min(max(0, position + action), self.state_size - 1)
        return new_position, reward

    def q_learning(self, episodes, start_position):
        for episode in range(episodes):
            position = start_position

            while position < self.state_size:
                action = np.random.choice([-1, 0, 1])  # Actions: move left, stay, or move right
                new_position, reward = self.step(position, action)

                # Q-learning update
                best_future_q = np.max(self.q_table[new_position]) if 0 <= new_position < self.state_size else 0
                self.q_table[position] = (1 - self.alpha) * self.q_table[position] + \
                                         self.alpha * (reward + self.gamma * best_future_q)

                position = new_position
                
    def recite_from_position(self, start_position):
        position = start_position

        recited_text = []
        while 0 <= position < self.state_size:
            recited_text.append(self.text[position])

            # Pick next action based on current Q-table
            action = np.argmax([self.q_table[position - 1] if position - 1 >= 0 else -np.inf,
                                self.q_table[position],
                                self.q_table[position + 1] if position + 1 < self.state_size else -np.inf]) - 1

            position, _ = self.step(position, action)
        
        return ''.join(recited_text)

# Example usage
text = "Reinforcement learning is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions."
reciter = TextReciterRL(text)
start_position = 0

# Train the model
reciter.q_learning(episodes=100, start_position=start_position)

# Recite text from a specific position
output = reciter.recite_from_position(start_position)
print(f"Recited text: {output}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Environment Setup**: The `TextReciterRL` class models the environment where each character in the text is a state.

2. **Q-Table Initialization**: The Q-table is initialized with zeros, representing the expected future rewards for each state.

3. **Step Function**: This function manages the movement within the text bounds and calculates the reward based on position validity.

4. **Q-Learning Update Rule**: The Q-values are updated using the reward and the maximum possible future reward, following the Q-learning algorithm.

5. **Recitation**: The `recite_from_position` function uses the Q-table to determine the best action at each step, simulating the recitation process.

### Limitations and Considerations:

- **Simplified Model**: This implementation is highly simplified and serves primarily as an educational tool to demonstrate basic RL concepts.
- **Action Space**: The action space is limited to moving left, staying, or moving right, which is a basic approach for text navigation.
- **Practical Applications**: For real-world applications, more sophisticated models and libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch would be necessary.

This example provides a foundational understanding of how RL can be applied to a text-based problem using NumPy, while acknowledging the limitations of such an approach for complex tasks.
